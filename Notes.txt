Requirements of Product:

1. Search form to lookup a song
	-- if not found, show error message
	-- if found, add to playlist view

2. Display of playlists
	-- title is an input field so you can change the playlist name
	-- adds the song title and artist to the list once it has been searched
	-- draggable so the songs can be resorted
		--will draggable list update mySql with order? Can I just get the order set on send?
	-- clicking on a song plays it in the html player above the playlist

3. Send button (This is the Nightmare Mode part, I expect!)
	-- takes list of titles and songs and saves that to database
	-- redirects to a new page "/playListName"
	-- needs to build a playlist from database info. 
	-- renders a playable playlist

Steps to Building:

1. The requests will require learning the SoundCloud API and making sure I can get and send the right information. If I can't do that, I won't have any of my functionality. (Meh, didn't work well and I didn't have time)

2. Setup basic page in Angular (DONE)
3. Build adding functionality to list (DONE)
4. Make player play songs added to the list (DONE)
5. Build dragging functionality to the list (I worked for a while with draganddrop and NgDragDrop and then decided this is not going to happen in this amount of time)

6. Send function
	Basic button is set up, so now I need to:

	-- Write a factory into Angular to make POST requests to a '/savePlaylist' or some such address
	-- In mixtape.js, write app.post ('/savePlaylist', someHandlerfunciton ) to route to requestHandler
	-- write to a function to send info to database
	-- Make a model in mongoos to set up the playlist schema
